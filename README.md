# perfectCircleDrawer
Python program specifically for drawing a perfect circle on neal.fun

The main program is circle.py
  • At the time of release, a resolution of 1920x1080, and in full-screen mode, this works on my computer 

If you're having issues with the main program, try circleCustomizable instead
  • It allows you to customize the radius of the circle as well as the number of steps
  • This version requires the cursor to be placed manually. What works best for me is centering the cursor on the white dot, and then moving one pixel down and one right
