# perfectCircleDrawer
Python program specifically for drawing a perfect circle on neal.fun

<b>The main program is circle.py</b><br>
&emsp;• At the time of release, a resolution of 1920x1080, and in full-screen mode, this works on my computer 

<b>If you're having issues with the main program, try circleCustomizable instead</b><br>
&emsp;• It allows you to customize the radius of the circle as well as the number of steps<br>
&emsp;• This version requires the cursor to be placed manually. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;↳ What works best for me is centering the cursor on the white dot, then moving one pixel down and one right
